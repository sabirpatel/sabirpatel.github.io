    <h2>Administration</h2>
   	<div id="accordion"  style="padding-left:1px;">
	  <h3><a href="#">Bibi S. Khoyratty, MD. - Managing Director</a></h3>
                    <div>
			   <p><img src="assets/bibi_khoyratty.jpg" width="192" height="255" alt="director" align="right" style="padding-left: 30px;"/>  			    
				<br/>Born and raised in Mauritius, Dr. Khoyratty specializes in hematology, oncology and internal medicine in Greater Twin Cities area. She is the Managing Director and the brain behind this great facility. She noticed in her professional experience that many patients, due to lack of insurance, were unable to get even mere consultation, let alone a full recovering treatment.</p> 
			    <p>With the help of her friends in the Muslim medical community, and support of Muslim Community Center in Bloomington, MN, she laid the foundations of this free facility open to everyone. She is often at the clinic when she is not even scheduled to be and shares the burden of the doctor when it gets busy. </p>
			    
			</div>
         <h3><a href="#">Ehtesham Khoyratty - Operations Director</a></h3>
                    <div>
                      <p><img src="assets/ehtesham_khoyratty.jpg" width="190" height="264" alt="director" align="left" style="padding-right: 30px;"/><br/>A chemical engineer by profession, Ehtesham Khoyratty is also a native of Mauritius and the Operations Director of the clinic. He is married to Dr. Bibi Khoyratty, and is a major player in the establishment of the Rahma Clinic. All the furniture and doctor's equipment was scrounged by Mr. Khoyratty and put to good use. He makes sure the clinic is fully supplied, personally calls each doctor to schedule when they can or cannot come, and keeps the third party vendors that the clinic gets services from in communication.</p>
			<p> Even when his wife is not scheduled to be the doctor on duty on Saturdays, you will often see Ehtesham at the clinic, mingling with patients, and keeping an active atmosphere. </p>
			</div>

         <h3><a href="#">Iqbal Kazi - Coordinator</a></h3>
                    <div>
			<p><img src="assets/iqbal_kazi.jpg" width="190" height="255" alt="director" align="right" style="padding-left: 30px;"/><br/>A semi-retired veteran of Minnesota Department of Transportation, Iqbal Kazi has been the chief Coordinator of the Rahma Clinic from day one. A native of India, he came to the United States more than three decades ago. Usually he is the first person you will see when you enter the Rahma clinic as he is the greeter, the receptionist, the scheduler, and more or less the public face of the clinic. When people call to set up an appointment, he is the one whose voice you hear.</p>
			<p>Mr. Kazi keeps the clinic in check, making sure doctors are reminded they are scheduled for Saturday mornings, supplies are not running low, volunteers are trained in, patients are provided the right paperwork, and always to keep smiling. </p>
